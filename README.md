# GitHashingExercise
Quiz-4

The first part of the project is a hash_script that  takes a 4-digit integer as a command-line argument, hashes it using SHA-256, and saves the input and the corresponding hash to a file named 'hash_output.txt'.The script also performs some basic input validation.

Next we continue with Siganls:
A C programm mysigcatch that  demonstrates how to register a custom signal handler for the SIGINT (Ctrl+C) signal. The 'sigint_handler' function is called when the program receives a SIGINT signal, allowing for custom actions to be performed before terminating the program gracefully.

Then we have another C programm that demonstrates a custom signal handler for the SIGINT (Ctrl+C) signal. The custom handler increments a counter each time SIGINT is caught. If SIGINT is caught twice, the program restores the default behavior for SIGINT, allowing the program to be terminated by Ctrl+C in the usual way.

Finally we explain how the codes of code-lab-4 are execuetd.
